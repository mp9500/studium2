## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(saqgetr) # Access to air quality data across Europe
library(lubridate) # Date and time related functions
sites <- get_saq_sites() %>% select(site, site_name)
df <- get_saq_observations(site = "desh027", start = 2018, end = 2020) %>%
saq_clean_observations(summary="hour", spread=TRUE) %>%
mutate(year = year(date), month = month(date, label=TRUE),
wday = wday(date, label=TRUE), hour = hour(date)) %>%
left_join(sites, by = "site")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
